* resolver
** ordering
   High-level checks implicitly depend on low-level checks of the
   sections that they use, but since there is no explicit need to
   access any of the low-level variables, these dependencies are not
   visible in the source.  So right now high-level checks will happily
   run even when no low-level checks passed, and can ever run before
   any of the low-level checks, since the dependecy resolver has no
   idea that there is a dependency in the first place.

* DWARF 4 support
  This to-do item is actually to go through the DWARF 4 standard and
  add TODO items for individual tasks.

  roland: i.e., block* forms can be constant-block or location in
  DWARF<=3, but only exprloc is a location in DWARF>=4; data* forms
  can be either constant or *ptr in DWARF<=3 but only sec_offset is
  *ptr in DWARF>=4.

** DW_AT_byte_size at DW_TAG_pointer_type

<mjw> machatap: I was surprised to see all these DW_TAG_pointer_type and
      DW_TAG_reference_type having an explicit DW_AT_byte_size

<mjw> machatap: I see that you added the following note in dwarflint:
							     [2010-09-06 17:00]
<mjw>     .optional (DW_AT_byte_size) // XXX added to reflect reality
<mjw> Any idea why reality is like that?
<machatap> mjw: yeah, the XXX meaning "we need to look into that"
<machatap> I'm afraid I added it there during the mass checks without also
	   putting it on the wiki or somewhere
<mjw> OK, so you also think that is strange. good. I might not be crazy after
      all :) [2010-09-06 17:01]
<machatap> well, it's certainly not per the standard
